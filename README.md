# Welcome to my profile
My name is Daniel, I'm a recently separated veteran and I'm looking to get into the software development field. I've been coding since I was in high school and I'm looking to finally start a career working on front or back end development.

My first language was Java, and my first job was the US Army (13F) so you know I can handle soul crushing work.

I'm sick and tired of hearing about a new Javascript framework that's going to finally fix web development once and for all every 6 months.

Can't wait for AI to finally take over and replace all developers (we're gonna reach singularity any day now)

## Current Skills, Languages, and Frameworks
  - Java
  - JavaScript
  - TypeScript
  - React
  - Express
  - SQL
  - Rust (?)
  - Linux (including server admin RHEL and Debian)
  - AWS
  - Docker
  - Neovim
