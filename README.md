# Welcome!!
I'm Daniel, I'm a recently separated veteran (brave enough to have joined, smart enough to have gotten out) and I'm looking to get into the software development field. I've been coding since I was in high school and I'm looking to finally take the next step in a new career.

My first language was Java, and my first job was the US Army (13F💥) so you know I can handle soul crushing work.

I'm sick and tired of hearing about a new Javascript framework that's going to finally fix web development once and for all every 6 months.

Can't wait for AI to finally take over and replace all developers (we're gonna reach singularity any day now)
